# BitBoard-Checkers
Gameplay:
When launched, the board is initialized in the standard Checkers layout:
Black pieces occupy the top three rows.
Red pieces occupy the bottom three rows.

Pieces move diagonally forward by one square.
Captures occur when an opponentâ€™s piece is adjacent and the space beyond it is empty.
When a piece reaches the far side of the board, it becomes a King, which can move both forward and backward.

The game ends when one player has no remaining pieces or no valid moves left.
The program declares the winner automatically.

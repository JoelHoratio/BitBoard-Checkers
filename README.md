# BitBoard-Checkers
Gameplay:
When launched, the board is initialized in the standard Checkers layout:
Black pieces occupy the top three rows.
Red pieces occupy the bottom three rows.

Rows and columns are labeled 0–7.
You’ll enter move positions as (row, column) pairs.

Pieces move diagonally forward by one square.
Captures occur when an opponent’s piece is adjacent and the space beyond it is empty.
When a piece reaches the far side of the board, it becomes a King, which can move both forward and backward.

The game ends when one player has no remaining pieces or no valid moves left.
The program declares the winner automatically.
